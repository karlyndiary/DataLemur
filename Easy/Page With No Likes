Assume you're given two tables containing data about Facebook Pages and their respective likes (as in "Like a Facebook Page").

Write a query to return the IDs of the Facebook pages that have zero likes. The output should be sorted in ascending order based on the page IDs.

```
SELECT p.page_id FROM pages p 
LEFT OUTER JOIN page_likes pl 
ON p.page_id = pl.page_id
WHERE pl.page_id is NULL
ORDER BY p.page_id
```
